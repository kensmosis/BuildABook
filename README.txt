NOTE: in this illustrative version, these will not work (some heuristic changes have been made, and most of the source files have not been included!)

To generate all the images (from original files):
	make -f Makefile.images all

To generate the print interior for Ingram:
	make book

To generate a draft:
	make draft

To generate ebook interior for Amazon upload:
	make ebook
	[Load into Sigil, have Sigil gen the TOC (choosing only level 1 headers), then save to a new file.  Amazon doesn't like the TOC generated by pandoc directly!  It will complain about broken links in the TOC without the Sigil step.]
