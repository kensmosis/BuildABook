### Status file for My Novel
### Tab-delimited
###
# This is the file used for organizing the book.  It may have any set of fields, but Type, Title, and Status are reserved.  In the example below, "Day" and "Style" are custom keywords.  I used "Day" only for my own internal organization of the timeline, and "Style" never ended up being used. 
# If I wanted to key off a custom field like "Style" or "Day" for status reporting I would modify ReadStatus.py and Status.py. 
# If I wanted to use a custom field like "Day" or "Style" in the book assembly (either for testing something or as part of a chapter subtitle), I would modify AssembleBook.py or EbookBuild.py
# As an example, if we wanted to have a chapter subtitle with the person whose perspective is represented (ala Game of Thrones), we could have a "Person" field. 
#
# The status field is a list of chars representing progress.  This affects the reports by Status.py.  The codes have specific meanings.  See ReadStatus.py for details.
# Status:  W= written, 1= round 1 edits, P= proofread, A= proofread edits applied
# 
# Title is the chapter title.  It may be used for internal purposes or as actual chapter titles.  In my book I ignored it.
# @PRE is a file prefix for the source files (ex.  "mydir/mychapter" if the files are "mydir/mychapterCDel1.md", etc. 
# @SUFF is the suffix for the files (.tex or .md, etc).
# @HEAD lists the fields
# @BOOK is the book name (I allow multiple books in a file, but don't recommend it!)
# The book name in @BOOK is that referenced in the scripts which rely on status.txt!
# The first field is the filename.  The actual filename is the @PRE$firstfield@SUFF
#
# Type:  
#		C= New Chapter.
#		S= New Section within existing chapter.  Depending on choices in AssembleBook and EbookBuild, may have a flourish separating it. 
#		I= No separation.  Use this when you want to split a file for organizational purposes, but it should have no affect on the book.
